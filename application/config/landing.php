| OkDate Landing Theme Code
| -------------------------------------------------------------------
| OkDate has an easy to use theme structure.
| We soon will have an feature to manage theme via Admin Panel.
|
| For now, We have two themes available -
| 1) lovevoo
| 2) cupid
|
| You can interchange between them by putting theme name in the default_style and style_dir variable
|
| If you are creating a theme yourself, You can do so by creating a new folder with an theme name in
| application/themes/landing and add three files
| 1) forgot.php -> Forgot Password page
| 2) register.php -> Sign Up Page  
| 3) welcome.php -> Homepage  
| 3) welcome_header.php -> Header  
| 3) welcome_footer.php -> Footer  
| 
|
